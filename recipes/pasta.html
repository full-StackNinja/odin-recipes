                "Kids absolutely loved this," Eddy Glover says.
                Don't let the silky sauce fool you. It's made from
                cauliflower, garlic, veggie broth, and Parmesan.
                No heavy cream here.

                </li>
                <li>
                    ⅓ cup water
                </li>
                <li>
                    ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
                </li>
                <li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in cauliflower and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Uncover and let cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor. Add cheese, water, and black pepper. Cover and pulse until smooth.

                <li>
                    Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions, adding broccoli and bell pepper the last 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return pasta mixture to pot and stir in cauliflower sauce. Heat through, stirring in reserved cooking water (if needed) to reach desired consistency. Garnish with basil, zest (if using), lemon juice, and additional cheese.
